Title: A High-Resolution Atlas of Uranium-Neon in the H Band

Description of contents: This package contains two FITS files. "une_wave.fits" 
    is the wavelength scale of the spectrum, "une_spec.fits". Both files have 
    the same dimensions, so plotting the spectrum vs. the wavelenth will 
    reproduce the combined extracted atlas spectrum.

System requirements: ds9 can be used to view these files, but a program that 
    can read FITS files (e.g.,readfits.pro for IDL) would be best.

Additional comments: The resolution of this spectrum is approximately
    50,000 (R = lambda / delta lambda).
